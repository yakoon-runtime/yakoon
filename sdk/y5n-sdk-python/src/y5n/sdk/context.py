"""Execution context — answers "where am I?".

This module is read-only. It provides the frozen snapshot of
the current invocation's starting conditions.

The raw invocation context is set by the engine through the Runtime API
(ADR-12 Section 4); this module is the typed, ergonomic view on it.

Usage:
    from y5n.sdk import context

    ctx = context.current()
    req = context.request()
    ses = context.session()
